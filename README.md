# Geode Dataset: Preprocessed Data and Analysis Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a preprocessed dataset (`preprocessed_data.RData`) and comprehensive analysis code (`data_analysis_final.R`) for a study examining cognitive performance differences between typically developing (TD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participants. The dataset includes behavioral data from a visual discrimination task involving counting flashes, along with demographic information and clinical assessments.

### Task Description

The data comes from a visual discrimination task where participants were presented with flashing stimuli on the left and right sides of the screen. Participants had to determine which side had more flashes and respond accordingly. The task included:

- **Stimulus presentation**: Flashes were presented in 10 temporal bins on each side
- **Response collection**: Participants made binary choices (left vs right)
- **Feedback**: Participants received feedback on their performance
- **Learning component**: The task included 200 trials to assess learning over time

The task was designed to assess visual processing, numerical discrimination, and learning abilities in different participant groups.
